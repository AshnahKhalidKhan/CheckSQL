Certainly! Below is a step-by-step visual representation of the data flow and functions involved in the code, from the moment the file input is selected:

```plaintext
  [File Input Selected]
           |
           v
   +-------------------+
   |    handleFileChange  | (FileInput.js)
   +-------------------+
           |
           v
   +-------------------+
   |    FileReader()     | (FileInput.js)
   +-------------------+
           |
           v
   +-------------------+
   |     onload Event    | (FileInput.js)
   +-------------------+
           |
           v
   +-------------------+
   |   onFileSelect()    | (Passed from Parent)
   +-------------------+
           |
           v
   +-------------------+
   | Parent Component  |
   | (e.g., App.js)    |
   +-------------------+
           |
           v
   +-------------------+
   |   State Updated   | (Parent Component)
   +-------------------+
           |
           v
   +-------------------+
   |      Render       | (Updated Content Displayed)
   +-------------------+
```

In this visual representation:

1. The user selects a file in the File Input component.
2. The `handleFileChange` function within the `FileInput.js` file is triggered when the input changes.
3. Inside `handleFileChange`, a `FileReader` is created to read the selected file's contents.
4. When the file is successfully loaded, the `onload` event (within `FileInput.js`) is triggered.
5. The `onFileSelect` function, which is passed from the parent component (e.g., `App.js`), is called with the loaded file's content.
6. In the parent component (`App.js` or similar), the state is updated with the received file content.
7. The updated content is then rendered in the component, displaying the file's contents to the user.

This visual diagram illustrates the flow of data and functions involved when a file input is selected and its content is processed and displayed in a React application.
